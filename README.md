# Eco Legacy
This mod is still under development.

## Background
> I know this is a clich√© story, but I think kindergarten children will like it, at least I like this story :)

You have been in this world for a long time, exploring every biome, visiting villages, sailing through oceans, and searching for treasures using the power of nature. Gradually, you have acquired what you believed to be absolute power. However, life became monotonous. But then you realized that things are not as simple as they seem. The hidden powers of this world far exceed your imagination. You begin to explore the ancient energies that lie deep within the world and harness them to create an unparalleled sword that gathers natural energy, granting you absolute power! This is an unprecedented journey for you, and it is destined to be challenging, but don't forget, nature will always stand behind you!
